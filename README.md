####  INTRODUCTION <a id='introduction'></a>
This repository contains codes for the solution to the assignment. There are two mail files **task_one.py** and **task_two.py**  which corresponds to task one and task two. Below are the sections for pre requisites to run the programs and DB setup.
> I have used docker for setting up database which proved very handy for bootstrapping DB within seconds.

#### PYTHON SETUP <a id='python_setup'></a>

<p style='font-size:5px;'> I have included requirements.txt file which contains list of the dependencies which are required to run these programs. I haven't used any fancy libraries for the development. </p>

To setup python simply run the below command:
>pip install -r requirements.txt

This could be done in global **Env** or any virtual **Env** if exist.

Python Version: **3.7.0**
